#### Sparesti - Spring Boot API
This project was worked on for the course System Engineering 2 (Systemutvikling 2) at NTNU Trondheim. We worked in large groups over three weeks, where studies were fully dedicated to this course during this time. The core concept of this project was a website aimed at helping users save money trough a gamified system. Users would take on long term saving goals and be suggested smaller saving quests to help them meet their goals. During this project I was the lead developer for the Backend API used by the website.
- Spring Boot
